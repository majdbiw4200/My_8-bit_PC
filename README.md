# My_8-bit_PC
This is a new project and its going to be an 8-bit PC using integrated circuits.
The PC will contain 2 registers F and W.
The PC will be able to execute the following instructions : ADDWF, SUBWF, MOVWF, CLRF, CLRW, ANDWF, XORWF, IORWF, DECF, INCF, COMF, RLF, RRF, C Flag, Z Flag, N Flag
The project will be build on a PCB with 6 layer board.
